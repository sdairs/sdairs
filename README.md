# Hello!

I've spent the past 10 years working in Cyber Security, Big Data & Realtime/Streaming. For most of that decade I've been a post-sales consultant, embedding with different data teams to help architect & build solutions with a range of tools & use cases.

In June 2022, I joined [Tinybird](https://tinybird.co) where I'm leading the Developer Relations team.
