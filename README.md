# Hello!

I've spent the past 10 years working in Cyber Security, Big Data & Realtime/Streaming. For most of that decade I've been a post-sales consultant, embedding with different data teams to help architect & build solutions with a range of tools & use cases.

In June 2022, I joined [Tinybird](https://tinybird.co) where I'm leading the Developer Relations team.

I don't consider myself a professional software engineer, although I spend a lot of time writing code. My most comfortable language is Python, though I am comfortable writing in Java/Scala/JavaScript/TypeScript/Groovy/Go/Rust/C/C#.

You'll find a lot of example & docs repos on my GitHub.
